TIBCO Software, Inc. has recently launched TIBCO&#174; BusinessEvents, an enterprise-level complex event processing (CEP) solution that helps companies move toward Predictive Business<span style="font-size:8px"><sup>TM</sup></span>.
TIBCO BusinessEvents collects an organization's multitude of structured and unstructured events, then correlates those events with one another to identify meaningful higher-level patterns that usually represent opportunities and threats to the organization.
TIBCO BusinessEvents uses real-time, scalable, high-performance business rules and other components to collect granular events from throughout the enterprise, then prioritizes and responds to the probable impact of those opportunities and threats so they can be addressed in real time.
Automated processes can be adapted on-the-fly and people can make decisions and take action in order to proactively remediate threats or take advantage of opportunities.
