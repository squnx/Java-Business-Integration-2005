Artix is the extensible enterprise service bus (ESB). It is Web services-based integration software for enterprise IT organizations with multiple generations of business applications, technologies, and architectures.
Artix makes these IT assets work together, forming the basis for an agile service-oriented architecture (SOA).<br><br>
Enterprise Service Bus is designed for high-performance enterprise integration IONA's extensible enterprise service bus is designed for complex, mission-critical enterprise integration challenges. It uniquely offers:<br><br>
<li>Extensibility, thanks to its plug-in architecture</li>
<li>Comprehensiveness, as a result of its broad, mobile-to-mainframe platform support</li>
<li>Reliability and performance, due to its support for security, high availability, management and transactions, among other enterprise qualities of service (QoS)</li>
<li>Ease of use, because of its integration with popular developer tools</li><br><br>
The typical Artix deployment involves multiple, long-lived business-critical systems. Few if any of these systems were originally designed for integration.
These systems retain enormous value, but with their incompatible architectures, technologies, transports, and security, transaction, and data models, they pose enormous integration challenges.<br><br>
Our customers tell us that the challenge is answered by Artix's extensibility. IONA's extensible enterprise service bus allows them to leverage and extend their existing systems, without having to make expensive and risky changes to them.
Artix's extensibility allows our customers to build secure, fault-tolerant integration systems that are easier to manage and deploy.
And as an extensible enterprise service bus, Artix promotes a low-footprint, high-performance integration solution that satisfies enterprise throughput requirements with significantly reduced overhead.<br><br>
For more than a decade, IONA&#169; Technologies (NASDAQ: IONA) has been a world leader in delivering high-performance integration solutions for heterogeneous enterprise environments.
IONA pioneered standards-based integration with its CORBA-based Orbix&#169; products.<br><br>
IONA delivers on the promise of service-oriented integration, making it possible for customers to achieve system longevity and agility at a significantly lower cost.
Artix is a noninvasive solution that service-enables existing systems without requiring changes to the systems and without denigrating qualities of service.
By leveraging rather than replacing existing infrastructure components, corporations can save millions in server costs alone.
