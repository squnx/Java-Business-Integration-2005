Active Webflow<span style="font-size:8px"><sup>TM</sup></span> Enterprise (AWE) is a comprehensive execution environment for deploying and managing BPEL-based business processes.
The product is available in multiple configurations, from small-footprint runtime engines suitable for desktop and mobile deployments, to enterprise-class servers that execute within leading J2EE<span style="font-size:8px"><sup>TM</sup></span> platforms.
AWE delivers all of the high-end capabilities required for enterprise process management including process versioning, process persistence, server load balancing, and fault tolerance.<br><br>
AWE combines the productivity of world-class visual BPEL authoring tools with the power of enterprise execution environments.
For process design, creation, testing and deployment, AWE includes ActiveWebflow Professional, a comprehensive BPEL authoring environment.
For runtime execution, AWE also gives you an unprecedented range of J2EE server options to meet all of your organization's needs&mdash;today and in the future.<br><br>
At the heart of AWE is a family of BPEL process servers that are optimized for market leading J2EE containers such as Sun<span style="font-size:8px"><sup>TM</sup></span> Java System Application Server.
AWE servers drop natively into their J2EE host environments, leveraging their Web services frameworks, their CPU cluster managers, and other critical resources.<br><br>
Because each AWE server is tuned specifically to meet the needs of your chosen J2EE environment, your BPEL deployments will deliver unsurpassed performance, precision, reliability, and scale.
Key benefits include:<br><br>
<b>Accuracy</b> - AWE servers support multi-level validation, allowing you to verify the validity of deployed BPEL process definitions as well as the format of all incoming message instances.
For production deployments requiring the highest possible performance, you may deactivate message validation.<br><br>
<b>Reliability</b> - AWE servers support process persistence, which caches state and message information at critical points during process execution.
If a server goes down, either unexpectedly or for maintenance, process executions will resume automatically when the server is returned to operation.<br><br>
<b>Scaling</b> - High-volume, high-performance process deployments require flexible scaling.
Even if your current projects don't need high-end scalability, you need to know that your BPEL server will always have the "legs" to grow with you.
AWE servers include advanced technology that works hand-in-hand with your application servers' cluster support, allowing you to effectively manage processing loads across your server farm.<br><br>
<b>Growth</b> - Processes, like most other applications, are not static. AWE servers accommodate your need to modify and re-deploy BPEL process definitions by providing comprehensive versioning features.
When you deploy a new version of a process, AWE allows you to decide how the new version of the process will interact with existing and future process instances.
You have the ability to schedule the introduction and retirement of the process versions and to manage the current 'in-flight' process instances to the appropriate process version.<br><br>
<b>Control</b> - Extensive run-time administration is provided through an extensible Web-based console.
Administrators and operations can configure the servers, manage the cluster, and view the current state of all running processes.
 For detailed process control and audit, AWE provides a graphical representation of the process state and access to real-time message information for maximum process transparency.
 All access to server administration is done via publicly supported APIs (both Java and Web services-based).<br><br>
<b>Transparency and Quality</b> - When it comes to complex process management applications, there is no one-size-fits-all technology.
 Recognizing this reality, Active Endpoints has exposed a wealth of internal server APIs via Web services.
 What's more, we are the first commercial BPEL solution provider to commit the source code of our core engine technologies into open source through our ActiveBPEL initiative, giving you the power and control you need to understand the internal workings of our servers.
