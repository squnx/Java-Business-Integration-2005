Sonic ESB is an enterprise service bus that simplifies the integration and flexible reuse of business components using a standards-based, service-oriented architecture (SOA).
Free of the inflexible and costly customization required by other middleware technologies, Sonic ESB lets architects dynamically configure the reliable connection, mediation and control of services and their interactions.<br><br>
Sonic ESB spans clusters and security infrastructures to form a federated environment which can be managed from any point.
Configurable service interaction eliminates hard-wired dependencies, so Sonic ESB makes it easy to deploy initial projects and, without disruptive recoding, swiftly evolve, scale, and extend them throughout the enterprise.<br><br>
On the Sonic ESB, all connected resources&mdash;whether a J2EE application, Web service, or legacy message broker&mdash;are first-class citizens.
These services are broadly available for dynamically-configured interaction with other services. Services can be scaled, moved or upgraded without disturbing other running services.<br><br>
Sonic ESB also offers robust, scalable and secure communications that seamlessly link services and processes across the extended enterprise.
